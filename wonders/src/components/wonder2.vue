    <h1>Wonder 2: Hanging Gardens of Babylon</h1>
    <p>The Hanging Gardens of Babylon are said to have been an extraordinary series of terraced gardens built in the ancient city of Babylon, near modern-day Iraq. Legend attributes their construction to King Nebuchadnezzar II, who supposedly created them to comfort his wife, homesick for her lush homeland. With cascading plants, intricate irrigation systems, and towering terraces, the gardens epitomized luxury and ingenuity. However, their existence remains debated, as no definitive archaeological evidence has been found.</p>
